This directory contains some functions for performing real-time groundwater level forecasts with Pastas. Two different functions are indcluded: a function to perform real-time forecasts with a single Pastas model and a function to perform forecasts with a Pastas project. Besides, example scripts are added in which the functions are used. The examples can be run easily: just copy the pastas-realtime folder to a specific location and change the working directory within the example scripts. The scripts can be run directly from the folder. Data and tools for running the examples are included as well. Also a documentation folder is added which includes a research in which the functionalities above are used.
